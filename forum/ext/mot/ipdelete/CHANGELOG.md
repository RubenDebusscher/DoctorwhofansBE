## [1.1.0] - 2021-04-26

### Added
-	Routine to check whether there are any posts assigned to another author by a moderator; if this is the case the IP address of those posts will be
	deleted, too
-	A `ext.php` file to check for the phpBB version used since the event data storing user information was added with phpBB 3.2.4; `IP Address Deletion`
	will therefore no longer support phpBB versions prior to 3.2.4
