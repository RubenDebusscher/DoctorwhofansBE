# Change Log
All changes to `Userreminder for phpBB` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.3.5] - 2021-04-06

### Added
-	A migration file to update version variable in `CONFIG_TABLE`

### Changed
-	The link to the users profile in the tables of the three "productive" ACP tabs is now computed by using phpBB's `append_sid` function using a relative path
	instead of using the config variables of the server to build an absolute path
	
### Fixed
-	Inserted a missing call to `sql_freeresult` in `acp/registrated_only_module.php` (new line 97), `acp/reminder_module.php` (new line 118), 
	`acp/zeroposter_module.php` (new line 133) and `event/main_listener.php` (new line 126)
-	Two typos in en language pack

### Removed
  
  
## [1.3.4] - 2021-03-01

### Added
-	A migration file to update version variable in `CONFIG_TABLE`

### Changed

### Fixed
-	A bug in `acp/zeroposter_module.php` and in `adm/style/acp_ur_zeroposter.html` which prevented users from being deleted in the `remind like inactive users`
	mode due to a mis-named select box

### Removed


## [1.3.3] - 2021-01-24

### Added
-	To the "productive" ACP tabs (Remind users, Sleepers and Zeroposters) the capability of being inserted into one other ACP tab by deleting the original
	modules and inserting new ones which differ in the `module_mode` from the respective `_info.php` file. In addition the new modules are inserted manually
	instead using the "automatic" method. This was necessary due to phpBB checking the `module_mode` during a call to the module against those already in
	the modules array (by ascending `parent_id` which means it will start with the "General" tab) and when encountering a `module_mode` a second time will
	not start the second module with an identical mode. Since a simple change in the `_info.php` files wasn't successful it was necessary to change the modules.
	Two new migration files (`ur_v_1_3_3_0.php` and `ur_v_1_3_3_1.php`) added for this purpose.
-	`README.md` file supplemented accordingly.
-	Userreminder now checks whether there are banned users and handles them as protected members to avoid reminding or deleting them. Affected files are
	`acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php` and `event/main_listener.php`

### Changed
-	Replaced own construction to seperate user names of protected members by "\n" with `implode()` function in `acp/settings_module.php`
-	Using class constants for the number of seconds per day in `common.php`, `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`,
	`acp/zeroposter_module.php` and `event/main_listener.php`

### Fixed

### Removed


## [1.3.2] - 2020-11-19

### Added
-	A config variable with Userreminder's version number with a new migration file `migrations/ur_v_1_3_2.php`
-	A footer line with version and copyright information on each of the ACP tabs (via including a new file `adm/style/userreminder_version.html`),  
	affected files are `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/settings_module.php`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php`,
	`adm/style/acp_ur_registratedonly.html`, `adm/style/acp_ur_reminder.html`, `adm/style/acp_ur_settings.html` and `adm/style/acp_ur_zeroposter.html`

### Changed
-	The usage of global variables in `acp/zeroposter_module.php` in order to make module useable in the extensions and the global tab simultaneously
	(so far without success)

### Fixed
-	A bug which selected sleepers, too, when reminding zeroposters automatically by adding another clause in the SQL query in `event/main_listener.php`, line 129
-	An error message when using a language Userreminder does not have a language pack for. Solved by checking for this language within Userreminder's language
	directory and falling back to the `en` language pack in `common.php`, new lines 219 - 226 and 319 - 338

### Removed
-	Two unused public variables from `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/settings_module.php` and `acp/zeroposter_module.php`
  
  
## [1.3.1] - 2020-11-13

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
-	A bug (using a wrong array for setting the time for `mot_reminded_one`) in `common.php`, line 184 resulting in overwriting the correct value for former
	reminders

### Removed
  
  
## [1.3.0] - 2020-10-30

### Added
-	A function to remind zeroposters including a new option on the settings page to enable/disable reminding zeroposters;
	affected files are `acp/settings_module.php`, `adm/style/acp_ur_settings.html`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php`, `adm/style/acp_ur_zeroposter.html`,
	`event/main_listener.php` (the latter for automatic reminding and deleting users) and all language files
-	Added a function in `event/main_listener.php` to check whether the user_id of a user to be deleted is part of the protected members config value
	and if yes, delete this user_id from the config value array
-	Added a new settings option to define groups which members will be excluded from being reminded and deleted, this group must be the default group
-	Migration file to insert the new above mentioned options into the config table and to convert the `protected_members` string into a json_encoded array
-	Added a check for protected groups affecting the `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php`
	and `event/main_listener.php` files

### Changed
-	Corrected the list of parameters while calling `$request->variable()` in `acp/settings_module.php`, lines 48, 49 and 51 (new lines 64, 65 and 67)
-	Inserted a backslash in `common.php` line 95 (new line 107) to adhere to phpBB coding guidelines
-	Adjusted SQL Queries in `common.php` lines 116, 144, 156 and 184 (new lines 128, 156, 168 and 196) to adhere to phpBB coding guidelines
-	Adjusted displaying usernames in all tables to the style commands used by phpBB (usernames are no longer in bold letters as a default).
	Affected files are `adm/style/acp_ur_registratedonly.html`, `adm/style/acp_ur_reminder.html` and `adm/style/acp_ur_zeroposter.html`
-	Changed the config value of `mot_ur_protected_members` from a comma seperated string into a JSON encoded array to enable conversion into a list of usernames
	for better readability in `acp/settings_module.php`. This change made it necessary to change all scripts where this config value is used, affected files are
	`common.php`, `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php` and `event/main_listener.php`
-	In the files `acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/settings_module.php` and `acp/zeroposter_module.php` the global variable
	`$language` was used. Since this global variable was introduced in phpBB 3.2.6 with Userreminder 1.2.1 an `ext.php` file was added to prevent installation
	on phpBB version 3.2.5 and earlier. In Userreminder 1.3.0 the variable `$language` is no longer acquired from the global variable but instead from the
	`phpbb_container` where it was introduced with phpBB 3.2.0. So the four ACP files are changed accordingly and the `ext.php` file checks now for
	phpBB versions later or equal to 3.2.0.
-	`README.md` file changed accordingly to reflect new functions and settings.

### Fixed
-	Corrected a typo in `common.php`, line 69 (`function_exists()` instead of `functions_exists()`)
-	Changed the definition of constant `SECS_PER_DAY` in `event/main_listener.php` to prevent warnings in PHP 7.4

### Removed

### Added
-	`README.md` file

-	Added JJGV as co-author in `composer.json`

### Changed

	in SQL queries in ACP module files `registrated_only_module.php`, `reminder_module.php`, `zeroposter_module.php` and in event listener file`main_listener.php`
-	Replaced the use of php comparison operator `<>` with `!=` in all php files to adhere to phpBB coding guidelines
-	Replaced `'AND user_id NOT IN (' . $config['mot_ur_protected_members'] . ') ';` with `'AND ' . $db->sql_in_set('user_id', explode(',', $config['mot_ur_protected_members']), true);`
	in SQL queries in ACP module files `registrated_only_module.php`, `reminder_module.php`, `zeroposter_module.php` and in event listener file`main_listener.php`
-	Included extension namespace for use with `INCLUDEJS` and `INCLUDECSS` in `adm/style/acp_ur_settings.html`

-	Changed variable `$this->secs_per_day` to constant `const SECS_PER_DAY = 86400;` in `event/main_listener.php`
-	Changed the use of double quotes inside the language strings to `Â´` in all language files
-	Changed the query in migration file `ur_v_0_5_0.php` setting the initial value of `USERS_TABLE` column `mot_last_login` to prevent possible time out on boards with many users

	who have received an email during that run). Subject file is `common.php`
-	Fixed the missing `script_path` variable when building the `$this->forgot_pass` variable in `common.php`'s constructor (an issue only if phpBB is
	installed in a subdirectory of the webspace, e.g. `www.my-webspace.net/phpBB`, experienced by one user)
-	Adjusted minimum phpBB requirement in `composer.json` to 3.2.6 due to use of global `$language`
-	Exchanged the use of super global `isset($_POST['delmarked'])` with `$request->is_set_post('delmarked')` in ACP files `registrated_only_module.php`,
	`reminder_module.php` and `zeroposter_module.php`
-	Changed all requested numeric variables in `acp/settings_module.php` to number as default in `$request->variable()` method
-	The link to the memberlist is constructed within the php file using the `$phpEx` variable and handed over to the html file as a variable instead of being
	hard coded within the html file (`acp/registrated_only_module.php`, `acp/reminder_module.php`, `acp/zeroposter_module.php` and
	`adm/style/acp_ur_registratedonly.html`, `adm/style/acp_ur_reminder.html`, `adm/style/acp_ur_zeroposter.html` respectively
-	Corrected type annotation in `event/main_listener.php`
-	Fixed wrong text encoding (ANSI instead of UTF-8) in file `migrations/ur_v_0_1_0.php`

**This version contains all changes necessary following the denied submission to phpBB extension database, re-submitted on 2020-06-29**
### Added
-	Since `$messenger->template()` does only work with text files `common.php` now checks whether the mail text to send is from a file or from the data base.
	In the latter case a new set of code is used to do all the things necessary to set addresses, replace variables (tokens) in the text and discern
	what method to use (new lines 133 - 173 and 251 - 291)

-	Optimized the code counting the number of different users in order to set variables for pagination
-	Some minor code changes to iron out small irregularities (w/o impact on the functionality)
-	Enhanced security by checking requested variables from user input in `settings_module.php`
