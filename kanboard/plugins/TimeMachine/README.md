------------------

**Plugin to add time machine : Back to the Future**

- *Add a Analytics Times on project Analytics sidebar* üìä :
    - "estimated vs actual time" comparison:
        - By swimlane
        - By categories
    - Spent time with start and end dates filter **!!! Attention! this is based on time tracking - 
with the timer functionality on subtasks !!!**

- *Add a form to edit start and end dates of subtask time tracking / timer ‚è±* 

- *Override Action:*
    - SubtaskTimerMoveTaskColumn
        
        // This doesn't work for now 
        
        Create a subtask and activate the timer when moving a task to another column 
        **with user session id (not with creator of the task)**
